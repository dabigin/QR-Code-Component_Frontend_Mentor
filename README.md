## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

#### Creating a Solution

I won't lie, as this is the first solution I worked on, I had to go watch videos on youtube to see how they did it to get the result I was looking for. Originally I set the background and I moved the attribution text to the top right and modified it so that it said that I did it.  

After that, I decided to start working on the card in the middle, with varying amounts of difficultly when trying to center the box on the page. I ultimately went with flex box and changed the attributes on the body of the page in order to get it in the center.  

Additionally, I played around with the colors off the template page and changed the background to the white color, and then I added the image. Then I made sure to move the text a few times, and changing the color and text to the right one. I imported the font from the google font page and embedded it into the html via a link tag. I had to edit the font weight on the font to fit the 400 and 700 respectively.  

I decided to use border radius on both the image, and the card div, in order to get the desired rounded look on the edges of both the card div and the image, to get it to look like the preview. I also changed the font color to the right color and changed the styling so that the font looked right on the h2 and paragraph. I played around with the sizes and got it looking similar to the example.  

In addition, I also added padding to the top of the h2 and p elements within the card, which gave the space that the design was calling for. I also added margin 0 and padding 0 to the entire page with the universal selector. I also had to add 40 pixels of padding underneath the paragraph in the card.  

At the close, I made sure to get the right size font, line height, and letter spacing, along with yanking something I seen off a youtube video so that the page was responsive when resizing. I believe it was ```margin: 0 1em;``` within the .card in the style sheet.

### Words of Encouragement

I hope you enjoyed reading, This challenge is one of the first of many. I also enjoyed trying to learn how to make markdown pages. I'm still a bit frustrated with it because I can't get it to work out I'd like, but I'll figure it out. I did grow quite frustrated along the way. Don't let that get you down. Have a blessed day and I hope you get this challenge done yourself if you are looking at mine.
